# Get Fellows Action

GitHub action to fetch all the fellows handles.

This action fetches all the fellows from the [on-chain data](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship) and output two objects with the usersâ€™ GitHub information.

It looks in the fellows data for a field named `GitHub` and it extracts the handle from there.

This action is intended to be chained with other actions that requires the fellows GitHub handles.

## Installation
This action is intended to be chained with other actions. It does not have any requirements.

We simply need to add the step:
```yaml
- uses: paritytech/get-fellows-action
  id: fellows
```

A working example where we print all the names is the following:
```yaml
name: Mention fellows

on: [push]

jobs:
  mention-fellows:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: paritytech/get-fellows-action
        id: fellows
      - name: Mention them
        run: |
          echo "The fellows are $FELLOWS"
        env:
          # the handles of the fellows separated by commas
          FELLOWS: ${{ steps.fellows.outputs.fellows }}"
```

### Outputs
You can find all the outputs in the [`action.yml` file](./action.yml).

They are:
- `fellows`: All the fellows handles separated by commas
	- Example: `user-1,user-2,user-3`
- `fellows-handles`: A JSON array with all the fellows GitHub handles
	- Example: `["user-1","user-2","user-3"]`
- `fellows-map`: A JSON array with objects of type  "user": "github-handle", "rank": rank (as a number)
	- Example: `[{"user":"user-1",rank: 4}, {"user":"user-2",rank: 2}, {"user":"user-3",rank: 1}]`
